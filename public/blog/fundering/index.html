  <p>Recently, we made the decision to pause development of our nurse call device. This post is a reflection on everything we worked on, what we accomplished, and where we went wrong.</p>
  
  <p>This was a direction that we have pursued for 8 months - 253 days of building, testing, and iterating.</p>

  <p>We prototyped, received feedback, and refined. We spoke with nurses, doctors, administrators, and just about anyone in medicine that would take a meeting. We saw the potential, the people we spoke with saw the potential, for what we were building to fundamentally change how patients and caregivers communicate. Here's a bit about the journey.</p>

  <p>What happens when a patient can't press a button or speak to call for help?</p>

  <p>In the earliest stages, that question led me to think about what could be done to bridge this gap, and why this is a problem that hasn't been solved.</p>

  <p>This led me to put a team together and visit Johns Hopkins University for a hackathon, a chance to prototype a solution and get feedback. We sketched out interfaces that relied on alternative input modalities, for patients who have limited use of their hands or inability to speak.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Digging deeper, I found that there are many situations in which patients are left without a way to communicate their needs. That realization drove everything we did next.</p>

  <h3>Phase 1</h3>
  <p>We started simple. The earliest version of the product was essentially an iPad app using the beta eye-tracking. The user would look at one of 6 icons on the screen and hold their gaze to select. It was clunky, barebones, and rushed, but it proved our concept and started conversations.</p>

  </div>

  <h3>Phase 2</h3>
  <p>Next, we focused on usability. The second version introduced a better user interface, with the added functionality of being able to record a message to then be transcribed and sent as a notification.</p>
  <p>We mounted the device and tested it in a hospital environment.</p>

  </div>

  <h3>Phase 3</h3>
  <p>The third version of the product moved beyond software. Much of the feedback we received pointed to a cost-effective option. The vast majority of facilities will almost always go for the cheapest option when considering nurse call systems. So, we began building a hardware prototype with the absolute core functionality, a mounted device that would be accessible to a patient lying face up.</p>
